### The "Schoolarchy" Model

This is the command we were running in with migrations.RunSQL to create the table

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW schoolarchy AS WITH formchoice_schools AS
  (SELECT jsonb_array_elements(jsonb_extract_path(formdesc.form_json, 'choices', 'school')) AS school
   FROM surveydata_formdescription formdesc,
        setting
   WHERE setting.key = 'FORMSPECDUJOUR'
     AND formdesc.form_json->>'name' = setting.blob->>'name'
     AND formdesc.form_json->>'version' = setting.blob->>'version')
SELECT (fs.school->>'name')::int AS school,
       (fs.school->>'cluster')::int AS clus,
       (fs.school->>'municipality')::int AS mun
FROM formchoice_schools fs;
```

To make this into a django ViewedModel

 - Add 'django-viewedmodels' to requirements.txt
 - pip install 'django-viewedmodels'
 - Create a model definition
 - Migrations
 - Run 'ViewedModels.recreate()'


In models.py (or inherited into models.py):

```python
from django.db import models
from viewedmodels.models import ViewedModel

class Schoolarchy(ViewedModel):

    materialized = True
    dependencies = (('surveydata', 'formdescription'),)

    @classmethod
    def sql(cls):
        return """
```
```sql
          WITH formchoice_schools AS
              (SELECT jsonb_array_elements(jsonb_extract_path(formdesc.form_json, 'choices', 'school')) AS school
               FROM surveydata_formdescription formdesc,
                    setting
               WHERE setting.key = 'FORMSPECDUJOUR'
                 AND formdesc.form_json->>'name' = setting.blob->>'name'
                 AND formdesc.form_json->>'version' = setting.blob->>'version')
            SELECT row_number() over () id,
                   (fs.school->>'name')::int AS school,
                   (fs.school->>'cluster')::int AS clus,
                   (fs.school->>'municipality')::int AS mun
            FROM formchoice_schools fs
      """
```
```python
    school = models.IntegerField()
    clus = models.IntegerField()
    mun = models.IntegerField()
```
